# Microservices

Microservices is an architectural and organisational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams. The microservice project integrates service discovery, load balancers in a containerised manner.

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
